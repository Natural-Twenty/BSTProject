# Basic Search Engine

This assignment was given by the UNSW COMP2521: Data Structures and Algorithms course.

This assignment mainly requires the implementation of a Binary Search Tree to store a linked list of words. The words in the binary search tree are sorted
in alphabetical order. The linked lists sorts the files that contain these words based on tf-idf that is calculated. This simulations a basic search engine where
you can search for key words and the engine will return the most relevant file that contains the key word(s).

The main aims of the assignment were to implement data structures that can appropriately store, sort and perform operations on the data.
Additionally, an algorithm is required to return the most relevant file according to key word inputs.

There are also applications of I/O with files and normalisation of words.
