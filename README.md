# An assignment given by UNSW COMP2521: Data Structures and Algorithms course.

This assignment mainly requires the implementation of a Binary Search Tree to store a linked list of words. The words in the binary search tree are sorted
in alphabetical order. The linked lists sorts the files that contain these words based on tf-idf that is calculated. This simulations a basic search engine where
you can search for key words and the engine will return the most relevant file that contains the key word(s).

There are also applications of I/O with files and normalisation of words.
